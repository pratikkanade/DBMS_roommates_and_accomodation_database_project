# Roommates and Accommodation Database Management System Project
ROOM&MATES is a web application designed to simplify the process of finding suitable accommodation and compatible roommates according to one's preferences. This innovative system addresses the challenges faced by individuals, particularly international students moving to new countries or regions, in their search for housing and potential cohabitants.
